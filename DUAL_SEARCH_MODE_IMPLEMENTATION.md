# Dual Search Mode Implementation - Complete Guide

## Overview
Successfully implemented dual search mode functionality in the SuperDiscover page, allowing users to search for both sustainable products and any products (including non-sustainable ones like iPhone 15 Pro).

## 🔄 **Two Search Modes**

### 1. 🌱 **Sustainable Mode** (Default)
- **Focus**: Eco-friendly and sustainable products
- **AI Prompt**: Searches for eco-friendly alternatives and sustainable options
- **Eco Score Range**: 70-95 (high sustainability focus)
- **UI Color**: Green theme
- **Example**: Search "iPhone 15 Pro" → Gets Fairphone, refurbished phones, etc.

### 2. 🛍️ **All Products Mode** (New)
- **Focus**: Any products, including non-sustainable ones
- **AI Prompt**: Searches for all products without sustainability filter
- **Eco Score Range**: 30-95 (realistic range for all products)
- **UI Color**: Blue theme
- **Example**: Search "iPhone 15 Pro" → Gets actual iPhone 15 Pro models

## 🎯 **Key Features Implemented**

### 1. **Search Mode Toggle**
```tsx
// Toggle between two modes with visual feedback
<button onClick={() => setSearchMode('sustainable')}>
  🌱 Sustainable
</button>
<button onClick={() => setSearchMode('all')}>
  🛍️ All Products  
</button>
```

### 2. **Dynamic AI Prompts**
```typescript
// Different prompts based on search mode
const sustainablePrompt = `Search for eco-friendly products related to "${query}"...`;
const generalPrompt = `Search for products related to "${query}". Include both eco-friendly and regular products...`;
```

### 3. **Smart UI Feedback**
- **Dynamic Placeholder**: Changes based on mode
- **Color Themes**: Green for sustainable, blue for all products
- **Search Results Header**: Shows which mode was used
- **Mode Badge**: Visual indicator in results

### 4. **Enhanced Search Function**
```typescript
// Updated function signature with mode parameter
static async searchProducts(query: string, mode: 'sustainable' | 'all' = 'sustainable')
```
